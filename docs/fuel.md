### Introduction

To run a thorium reactor, you need two types of fuel:
first the thorium-carrying fluid, [Molten Salt](#molten-salt-production).

After that, you need [Enriched Uranium Pellets](#enriched-uranium) to start the actual physical reaction inside the reactor.

If you don't have an energy generator yet, craft yourself a [Fuel Generator](http://127.0.0.1:8000/machines/#fuel-generator)!

### Molten Salt Production

??? quote "1. Sodium Production"
    To start with producing you need a [Fluid Evaporator](machines.md#fluid-evaporator). <br>
    Place it down - fill it up with some water through the left port and apply energy to it though the port on the back.

    Now you will see, that your evaporator is **running** and evaporating your water fluid. <br>
    The process of gaining one Sodium takes 20 seconds and consumes 400mB of Water.

??? quote "2. Potassium Production"
    For this you need a [Electrolytic Separator](machines.md#electrolytic-separator). <br>
    Place it down - fill it up with some water through the left port and apply energy to it though the port on the back.

    Now you will see, that your electrolytic separator is **running** and extracting potassium salt out of the water fluid. <br>
    The process of gaining one potassium takes 15 seconds and consumes 300mB of Water. <br>
    Take note that the consumed water is 1:1 being output afterwards.

??? quote "3. Molten Salt Production"
    After you have extracted your sodium and potassium, you still need some thorium! If you dont have some yet, swing your shovel and find some!
    Then you will need a [Salt Melter](machines.md#salt-melter). <br>
    Place it down and apply energy to it though the port on the back. 

    Add your potassium in the top slot, your thorium in the middle one, and your sodium in the bottom slot. <br>
    Afterwards your [Salt Melter](machines.md#salt-melter) will start heat up to its working temperature and melt it into molten salt fluid 
    The process of gaining 100mB molten salt takes 40 seconds and consumes one Potassium, Thorium and Sodium each. <br>

And there you got your first Molten Salt!

### Enriched Uranium Pellet

??? quote "1. Baking some yellow cake!"
    Take your [Concentrator](machines.md#concentrator) and put your uranium in! Dont forget to power it! <br>
    It will concentrate your uranium into yellow cake, needed for the next steps!

??? quote "2. Decomposing"
    Grab yourself your [Decomposer](machines.md#decomposer). <br>
    Insert your fluorite in the top slot and fill it up with water. <br>
    200mB of Hydrofluorite will be produced every 5 seconds!

??? quote "3. Oxidizing"
    After you got your Yellow Cake and Hydrofluorite, fill it into the [Uranium Oxidizer](machines.md#uranium-oxidizer) <br>
    It will turn 400mB of Hydrofluorite together with one yellow cake into 400mB Uranium Hexafluorite in 40 seconds.

??? quote "4. Enriching"
    Fill your lastly gained Uranium Hexafluorite in a [Fluid Centrifuge](machines.md#fluid-centrifuge). <br>
    When running it will turn 1mB of Uranium Hexafluorite into 1mB of Enriched Uranium Hexafluorite per 1 second. <br>
    Due to that slow enriching process, you probably need more than one of it!

??? quote "5. Crystallizing"
    To use your Enriched Uranium Hexafluorite, fill it into a [Crystallizer](machines.md#crystallizer). <br>
    It consumes 250mB of Enriched Uranium Hexafluorite to turn it into one Enriched Uranium Pellet in 25 seconds. <br>
    Use that gained pellets to fuel up your reactor!

Now you got your first Enriched Uranium Pellet. Only 809 left to fuel up one reactor! :D
Don't worry
