### Introduction

For all future recipes, we need a foundation to craft all machines, tools, blocks, etc.
But, we aren't using the normal crafting table, but a thorium crafting table!

Mostly all recipes are being crafted in the 5x5 crafting area!

**The [Just Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei){:target=”_blank”}   Mod is highly recommended for crafting!** <br>
Otherwise, recipes can be seen in [Recipes](recipes.md)
